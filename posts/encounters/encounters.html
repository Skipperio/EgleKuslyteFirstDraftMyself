          <p>Hello,</p>

          <p>how are youu?</p>

          <p>
            I heard new Black Eyed Peas song with Shakira and David Guetta â€“
            Donâ€™t you worry and they reminded me of a movie Close encounters of
            the third kind. Steven Spielberg of course. I admire this director
            he is one of my favourites.
          </p>

          <p>Letâ€™s talk about this old 1977â€™s Sci-fi, drama.</p>

          <p>
            I completely forgot that I enjoyed it so much, it left such a good
            vibes for me. SPOILERS. It is one of the movies that potray aliens
            as good. Most of the alien movies are dangerous, scary and not
            friendly. This movie gives another perspective, perspective that
            people usually donâ€™t think about. As we people tend to take
            everything as a threat. We are so full of fears that we going for
            the worst case scenarios all the time. But life is good too. There
            are so many good things happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            I recommend to watch this just because it is different. Also, as an
            old movie the action might look slow. Nowadays movies are so quick,
            drama is immediate and it loses its beauty. It loses the climax
            beauty that makes film a good film. If you gonna be patient you
            going to be surprised. ðŸ˜‰
          </p>

          <p>
            This movie also gives me cozy vibes same as Harry Potter, makes me
            feel better.
          </p>

          <p>
            BUT BUT BUT. Can we talk about aliens overall? Are you a believer?
            Have you ever had any encounter with them? Maybe you saw something?
            Please, let me know. I would love to know.
          </p>

          <p>
            I donâ€™t know why but I always had half half opinion about aliens.
            There were times I believed in vampires because of reasons. But I
            actually even have notes where I ask aliens help, as this life on
            earth is too heavy, I asked them to safe us. Maybe I was referring
            to angels at the time, but I called them aliens. Also, I had a dream
            were aliens are after me and every single time they were closer
            untilâ€¦. They finally catched me. After they catched me, something
            happened in reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            I donâ€™t know how they look like, I never had any actual view of
            them. But the feeling was always so strong in dreams. Although, we
            have sooo many drawings of them, but I only remember spaceships.
            Still not clearly. Until I had one experience which I forced myself
            to forget as after that I couldnâ€™t sleep. Literally, I was afraid to
            go to sleep as I thought it will happen again. Experience wasnâ€™t
            pleasant and I have never ever experienced anything like this
            afterwards or before. I wasnâ€™t actually even believing aliens or
            looking for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was studying at the time and I was only volunteering for some
            time. When this happened I even went to doctor and she send me to
            neurologist.. Visit to neurologist was weird as hell. It was winter,
            yes. We have cold winters in Lithuania. I went to this neurologist
            cabinet, started talking, she literally was making fun of me saying
            that I spend too much time on computer and so on. Then I noticed a
            really weird green insect on the table (I think, or maybe on her
            hand sleeve). It scared me as what on earth this insect is doing in
            winter here. I stopped talking. I have no idea why, but I took as a
            sign not to say anything anymore. In the end I agreed to anything
            she was saying and I left. Let me explain about computer, I was not
            spending time as 1. I have laptop. 2. I had to split my time on
            laptop with my mom. 3. I was too busy studying, reading things than
            staying on pc as she was referring to gaming, not simple studies.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that I had a trip for Christmas in Poland, me, my ex-bestie
            and my mum went to Warsaw for one day lol. ðŸ˜€ it was fun as we had
            to be 9 hours in a bus.. Something happened in the bus. You all
            probably have heard of The X-files TV-Show. Bus had those small
            tablets on the seats were you could watch some films and TV-shows.
            Here I am searching something interesting and finally I came across
            The X-files as this one was the only I wanted actually to watch.
            There were only 6 or 8 episodes and I watched 1st. I never ever in
            my life felt relatable to the content I was seeing. The X-files are
            about aliens, but I wonâ€™t spoil. Watch it yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then I found random page which had about 30 signs that you
            experience when you have encounter with aliens and oh boy so many of
            them suited my situation. As apparently it was not only that one
            night something happened, it started even before, but I just didnâ€™t
            know what was happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would love to tell you whole experience but I need my old diary
            for that and I donâ€™t have it at the moment. The only thing, I think
            they healed me. Although whole experience was terrifying but I think
            they did something good to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            That is why years later when I saw this S.Spielberg movie I
            understood how true it is. Also, I watched TV-Show Project-Blue
            Book. Information, experience, fits sooo good. BUT
          </p>

          <p>
            I do agree that there are still a lot of bullshit reports, a lot of
            fakes. That is why in the end I decided to forget about it and stay
            sceptical. Aliens are good, that is the thing everybody should
            understandâ€¦ (because in the very tiny possibility, aliens might be
            just future people ðŸ˜‰ ).
