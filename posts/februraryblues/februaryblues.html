          Hiii, so I got a theme suggested for my post and here I am writing
          about it. February blues. At first I got confused as I didn’t know
          what does it mean. I googled. I found this explanation: “About 2
          million people in the UK, and 12 million across northern Europe, are
          thought to have the “winter blues”, a form of depression characterised
          by low mood, fluctuations in appetite and heavy sleeping, which peaks
          in January and February each year”.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found this information: “February is one of the worst months
          for SAD. It’s a type of depression that occurs during the darker,
          winter months each year”.
        </p>
        <p>
          If to be honest I never noticed that winter is sad to me, I mean yes,
          you cannot do outdoor activities much, but like winter is exciting to
          me, I have my birthday on January and now not only mine but my
          boyfriend’s and friends birthdays. On February I am excited about st.
          Valentine’s day and the knowledge that March is coming soon. Usually,
          in Lithuania January and February are the coldest months, we get a lot
          of snow and snow storms. At least this is how it used to be. Now with
          climate change last 4 years we had snow for a few days, which actually
          made me depressed :/ Now that I am in UK, the weather is constant in
          here, nothing much changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, now that I know people get more depressed this time it makes
          me wonder why. Probably, the main reason is that we get less sun and
          less light in a day. People feel more sleepy than usual. But another
          reason came to my mind as well. December is really hyped up month,
          everyone is excited, waiting for presents and Christmas, preparing to
          meet family etc. I think December on emotional level is so high up so
          when January comes and all celebrations are done people emotions just
          drops so low that you want it or not you feel depressed. I read so
          many books and heard from Buddhist’s that you shouldn’t let yourself
          to be too happy or too sad. Every emotion should be in a middle
          average, so later it wouldn’t affect you too much. I agree with this a
          lot as tried myself to look at everything same way. Like if something
          good happens, accept it, celebrate it and move on. Don’t focus only on
          it as when the small bad thing happens you feel soooo low….
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t have this blues just because January and February are exciting
          months. To be honest for me most depressing months are November and
          October (except from 31st of October). Like nothing much happens,
          weather is usually terrible and these months for me is a freeze. A bus
          stop where I am waiting for Christmas.
        </p>
        <p><h2>What we can do about it?

        </h2></p>
        <p> I think everybody should have holidays on these months, go somewhere to a sunny country or any vacations. If I feel sad I try to come up with some activities to do. Go to a cultural events, try some new cafes or go do something I haven’t done in a long time like bowling or mini golf. Go to gym or a pool. Literally, nowadays we have plenty of indoor activities. Winter is the best time to appreciate warmness and home. ❤ Or find some online courses and when you have free time check them out! Many many things to do.</p>
      <p>Also, let’s care about each other more, if your friend or close person feels down or depressed, give them more attention or try to help, sometimes simple words like – I love you and appreciate you – can help a lot.</p>
