            <p>Hello,</p>
            <p>recently I had a honor to visit Liverpool. 4 days journey made me go through a lot of emotions and experiences. In the end, I understood, that this is just another city with same earthly problems.</p>

            <p>First day was exciting. Going with a bus from Leicester, stopping in Birmingham to change a bus and continuing to Liverpool. I chose this destination because I wanted to be near by the water and this city is cheaper than the others by seaside. We arrived quite late about 15 pm but because we had energy we had 1 hour and 15 minutes walk to the waterfront, one of the Liverpool docks. I was happy. Seeing the water and hearing it made me feel cozy and reminded me of Lithuanian seaside. We walked by the waterfront quite long distance. About 30 minutes, we stopped at one cafe or restaurant I am not sure and we had a good pizza. After that again walk back home 1,5 hour.</p>

            <p>Next day. We woke up pretty early, so we could have time as the forecast said it will start raining at 2 pm. We walked to City Centre, first thing that caught my eyes was a Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. It was something I have never seen before.</p>

            <p>Later we popped quickly to one cafe which was next to waterfront and we had some tapas, it was good. Then we went to visit famous sculpture of The Beatles.</p>

            <p><img src="/travelling/liverpooltrip/img_20211124_121902.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>We walked through Royal Albert Dock, but I will show you some pictures later as we came back there more than once. By the second time I thought how nice it would be to live there. Before rain started we went to Liverpool Cathedral, I felt like I am in Hogwarts.</p>

            <p>Rain although destroyed magical feeling, we ran closer to city shopping hall and randomly chose some restaurant (literally there were small ice cubes falling on us). Bella Italia popped in front of our eyes. My true and honest review – do not go there. At least in Liverpool. The service was not bad, but the food was awful for the price we were paying. I chose salmon, and my salmon was dry and not tasty, the sauce with it was disgusting itself. The size of it was enough for me, but my boyfriend took some kind of another dish with meat and few potatoes on top. For one dish price was 14,5 pounds something like that. It was not worth it all. Later in the evening for dinner we cooked our own pasta with sauce and cheese, even this was much more tasty…</p>

            <p>Exciting Thursday! So, day before I said to myself that I want an adventure, so we google nearest beaches and here we go. We visited Crosby beach!</p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>After being there for at least 4 hours, we took a train back and walked through city, I bought a new coat from TK maxx, then again we came to visit Royal Albert Dock and we popped in to have some cocktails at Peaberry Coffee House and Kitchen. Loved the cocktails and the staff. Awesome experience.</p>

            <p>On the last day, everything went 180 degrees opposite. The forecast said it is gonna rain all day, so we decided to go to museums. We went to World Museum and saw a lot interesting stuff. I am not gonna upload any pictures as it is gonna be a spoiler. Anyway, after that we wanted to go to City Centre, and in our surprise some main streets were closed with police protection. Immediately I wanted to check what happened.</p>

            <p>Then I read a title of terrible event, so basically, 12 years old girl was murdered on one of those streets, previous night at 8pm (by that time me and my boyfriend were far away at our AirBnB) 13, 14 and I think 15 years old boys were caught running away from a crime scene. Reading that was such a huge shock for me. 12 years old girl… Boys who are just teenagers came with an idea to stab her… Where is our world going? What is happening? Literally, all day for me was ruined, I couldn’t think of anything else… The fact that we might have been there… The fact it happened in the middle of Centre… Here is a link of what is going on now:</p>

            <p>
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/28/boy-14-charged-with-of-ava-white-in-liverpool">theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/28/boy-14-charged-with-of-ava-white-in-liverpool</a>
            </p>

            <p>R.I.P. Ava…</p>
            <p>This event made me understand, that Liverpool is just normal, another basic city, where who knows what might happen like everywhere else. There is no safe place for humans, there is no safe age, there is nobody safe. It just makes me sad and angry that other can take somebody life. We are fighting everyday for our well-being, with other people, why we still are not getting to a higher level and why we still allow bad feelings to influence us?</p>

            <p>….</p>
            <p>Yeah, not much happened on Friday, we went to Chinese restaurant which I really enjoyed. It is called – New Capital Chinese Restaurant. Would highly recommend.</p>

            <p>On Saturday, early we went to a bus and home. In the bus was no space for two seats, so I was sitting separately from my boyfriend and apparently I was sitting next to another Lithuanian! We talked with her and had a good laugh. ❤</p>

            <p>My conclusion, I had so many things happening in a few days that I was somewhere else. Life is a miracle and hell in one…</p>
