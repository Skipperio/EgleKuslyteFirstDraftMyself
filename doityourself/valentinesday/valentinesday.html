          <p>Heeyy, how are you?</p>
<p>I am in self-isolation which is absolutely not fun. But while time is passing I‚Äôve decided to do some home-decorations or just a few simple things that makes your home space not too white or sad.

  I enjoy doing decorations for every occasion. It makes my creativity do whatever it wants. So just a few simple ideas how can you make your own space feel more special.</p>


<p><h2>1. Hearts with letters, making any word you like.</h2> 
<div class="grid"><img src="hearth.jpg" alt=""></div> <img src="hearth2.jpg" alt="">
</p> 


<p>
As you may see I simply cut out heart shapes, I have these heart shaped stickers with letters and I just stuck them on top of the pink heart. Then I used Blu Tack to stuck the hearts on the wall. I chose to make word LOVE, but it is up to you what you prefer.

2. Thoughts about love with your own made poster.


I would call it as a poster as I simply took some colored paper, cut some hearts and wrote down some thoughts about love. You can put this in an actual frame, or customize it however you want. Easy and quick. I also hang it above my and my boyfriend photos so it would have a deeper meaning.

3. Balloons.


Yep, that is simple as well, but you can buy different shapes and colors of balloons. You can hang them anywhere and it feels much more festive immediately!

4. Customize your phone, computer and etc.


I find really important to change my keyboard, all the wallpapers and colors to a certain occasion on electronics. Sometimes I change things just because I am bored or I need inspiration. Customization is such a fun, especially nowadays when you can have different pics, or even apps to make your laptop or phone look much nicer.

5. Color some image from coloring book.


You may have seen this before, but yeah, I colored it, cut it to a heart shape and hanged it on my wardrobe doors. Looks nice and you can color it anyway you want. You can frame it as well or hang it on a wall (or give it as a present to somebody üòâ

6. Lights up.


Sooo, I bought these red lights from amazon, literally for 2,50 pounds. You just need 3 batteries but all of us have some batteries at home. Then my boyfriend gave an idea to make heart shape from this. We made it and hanged it again with that Blu Tack (it holds them perfectly). These red lights at the evening or night gives such a romantic atmosphere, I swear it is worth it. ‚ù§

If I inspired you leave the comment below, or send some pictures what you do with your interior design, maybe you have some ideas to suggest?

        <p><h2>What we can do about it?

        </h2></p>
        <p> I think everybody should have holidays on these months, go somewhere to a sunny country or any vacations. If I feel sad I try to come up with some activities to do. Go to a cultural events, try some new cafes or go do something I haven‚Äôt done in a long time like bowling or mini golf. Go to gym or a pool. Literally, nowadays we have plenty of indoor activities. Winter is the best time to appreciate warmness and home. ‚ù§ Or find some online courses and when you have free time check them out! Many many things to do.</p>
      <p>Also, let‚Äôs care about each other more, if your friend or close person feels down or depressed, give them more attention or try to help, sometimes simple words like ‚Äì I love you and appreciate you ‚Äì can help a lot.</p>
