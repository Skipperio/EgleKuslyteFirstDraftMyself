<p>Is the philosophy still in our life?</p>
<p>            Do we still ask questions? Are we curious about what is happening around us? Is it important what is happening and why? Do we care why, what, how?</p>
            
           <p> What is your relationship with philosophy?</p>
            
           <p> Do you know what philosophy is?</p>
            
           <p> I know that our lifestyle changed a lot. People always are in hurry, we don’t stop and don’t enjoy the moment we are in. We always thinking about something, we are trying to solve some kind of problem. There is no time to ask questions, to think about life itself. We don’t have time anymore to discuss simply things. Like, why we feel emotions? Why do we have thoughts? Why we are on earth and not on the Mars? Why and when we are happy? Why and when we are sad? Why weather influences our mood? </p>
            
           <p> Too many questions? You don’t have time to think about these things? Why? </p>
            
          <p>  I don’t think I need to answer where the philosophy is gone. Philosophy itself is here. Right now. But we don’t give a time for it. We keeping forget it. The better question would be – what we lose? Philosophy for me is a joy of life. Without philosophy I would see life just black and white. And now I can see colors in it. Sometimes I walk in the park and I seek for answers that I might never have opportunity to know. But I notice everything. The birds, the leaves on the tree, squirrels, I see insects, I see patterns of nature. I look at the grass, bushes, clouds, sun or moon. I breath in air, I feel it. Also I notice and I feel that because I am in unity with earth. But when you notice things it helps you to ask questions. You let philosophy in. </p>
            
         <p>   To get rid off philosophy is no good. There won’t be anything. Because we always need to ask – what if? </p>
            
         <p>   We wouldn’t be able to even get to the space without philosophy. If everybody would care only about themselves and their appearance, we would extinct. </p>
            
         <p>   So basically, we lose everything without it. Philosophy is always about questions that nobody has answers to yet. Key word is yet. In the future other people will find out. And where would we be without thoughts about the future? Where would we be if we only live in now? No where. </p>
            
         <p>   Philosophy lets us to take a step further. Philosophy is crucial in our world. But not everyone understands that. A lot of people understands philosophy only when somebody dies or when we experience some kind of traumas. But as proverb says – better later than never. </p>
            
         <p>   So, I am more positive about philosophy. Maybe because people that are around me also likes to ask questions. Philosophy is for everyone. It is free. But it’s heavy. People would rather buy something expensive but easy…. But what is worth more? </p>
            
          <p>  What is a bigger value to your personality and your spirit? </p>
