                <p>Hello guys,</p>

<p>so this time I am going to talk about the book which came to me on my birthday. Matthew McConaughey’s – Greenlights.</p>

<p>I never thought biography can be so compelling and interesting. To be honest I am not a fan of this actor, (I don’t have nothing against him either) I have seen movies with him, one of the recent was Interstellar. But I really like his voice.</p>

<p>This book is not only about Matthew’s life, it is much more. Inspiration, motivation and confirmation. His story pulled me in immediately and to read biography of a person you have never met is quite unique experience. I think everyone should write biographies, there is so much to learn from it.</p>

<p>I don’t want to spoil anything, but I really recommend this to read. Especially if you are into film industry. This helps to see actor perception and to understand what to expect from behind the scenes of this industry. Also, I recommend this for people who are into spiritual things, who believe and wants to believe. Lastly, I recommend for people who needs motivation or new ideas. ‘Greenlights’ is valuable and memorable book.</p>

<p>This book also has recorded audio, so you can also listen to this actor voice and be more close to his reactions and experiences.</p>

<p>Some thoughts from the book:

<p>“To agnostics: Just because it says anonymous doesn’t mean it has no author”.</p>

<p>“We are not here to tolerate our differences, we are here to accept them. We are here not to celebrate our sameness, we are here to salute our distinctions. We are not born into equal circumstances, or with equal abilities, but we should have equal opportunity. As individuals, we unite in our values. Celebrate that”.</p>

            </p>
